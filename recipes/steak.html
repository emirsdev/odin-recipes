        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A steak is a thick cut of meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, 
            sometimes including a bone. It is normally grilled or fried. Steak can be 
            diced, cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and 
            formed into patties, such as hamburgers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Steaks are cut from animals including cattle, bison, buffalo, camel, goat, 
            horse, kangaroo, sheep, ostrich, pigs, turkey, and deer, as well as various 
            types of fish, especially salmon and large fish such as swordfish, shark, 
            and marlin. For some meats, such as pork, lamb and mutton, chevon, and veal, 
            these cuts are often referred to as chops. Some cured meat, such as gammon, 
            is commonly served as steak.
