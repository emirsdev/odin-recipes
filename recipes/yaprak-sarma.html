        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Sarma is a traditional food in Ottoman cuisine 
            (nowadays, Turkish, Greek, Armenian, etc.) made of vegetable leaves rolled 
            around a filling of minced meat, grains such as rice, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is commonly marketed in the English-speaking world as stuffed grape leaves, 
            stuffed vine leaves, or stuffed cabbage leaves. The vegetable leaves may be 
            cabbage, patience dock, collard, grapevine, kale or chard leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sarma is part of the broader category of stuffed dishes known as dolma, 
            and has equivalents (such as the Polish Gołąbki) in Eastern European cuisines 
            from the northern Baltic through Ukraine.
