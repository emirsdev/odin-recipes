        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Contrary to popular opinion, French press coffee is not just for coffee snobs. 
            But it certainly doesn't hurt to be one if you're looking to dive into this 
            popular brewing method. French press is a simple, manual brewing method that 
            gives you total control over your brew. Really anyone can do it, and it's one 
            of the least expensive brewing methods available. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The first time you set out to make French press coffee, just the sight of the 
            French press coffee maker can be a little intimidating. But it's actually one 
            of the simplest brewing systems, and it's been around since the 1850s. 
            According to legend, its invention was a happy accident. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The story goes that a Frenchman was boiling water when he realized he had 
            forgotten to put the coffee in. He decided to add the coffee grounds to the 
            boiling water nonetheless. Once the coffee grounds rose to the top, he used a 
            piece of metal screen and a stick to press the screen down together with the 
            grounds. The result? It was the best coffee he had ever tasted.

            Despite this fun origin story, the patent of the French press coffee maker 
            came from the Italians. With time, the version has continued to evolve into 
            the French press we know today â€” or a manual brewing system in which coffee 
            grounds are steeped in hot water before being pressed to the bottom of the 
            beaker, helping to separate the grounds from the liquid.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 cup water (8 fluid ounces)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons coffee beans (14 grams)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The first step to fabulous French press coffee is to warm up the press. 
                You can do this by boiling water and rinsing out the press. This will help 
                maintain the temperature while brewing.

            <li>
                Next, it's time to measure and grind your coffee beans. Start by measuring 
                your desired amount of whole coffee beans (1 teaspoon full is approximately 
                5 grams). Use a burr grinder to grind whole coffee beans into coarse, 
                consistently-sized grounds. 
            </li>
            <!-- <img src="../images/french-press-coffee-2.webp" alt="Image showing the french press coffee after step 2"> -->
            <li>
                Discard any hot water from the French press, and add the coffee grinds to 
                the empty press. Bring your desired amount of water to a boil, and then 
                allow it to cool for one minute. Pour the water into the French press.
            </li>
            <!-- <img src="../images/french-press-coffee-3.webp" alt="Image showing the french press coffee after step 3"> -->
            <li>
                Using a long spoon or stirrer, stir vigorously to break up the top layer. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Allow the coffee to steep for an additional four minutes. Once the timer 
                goes off, gently push the plunger all the way to the bottom of the press. 
                Serve immediately, although you can always store any leftover coffee in a 
                thermos to keep it warm for a while longer (but not too long, as it will 
                start to get bitter as it sits). Congratulations! You've just made French 
                press coffee.
