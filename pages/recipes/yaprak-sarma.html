        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Sarma is a traditional food in Ottoman cuisine 
            (nowadays, Turkish, Greek, Armenian, etc.) made of vegetable leaves rolled 
            around a filling of minced meat, grains such as rice, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is commonly marketed in the English-speaking world as stuffed grape leaves, 
            stuffed vine leaves, or stuffed cabbage leaves. The vegetable leaves may be 
            cabbage, patience dock, collard, grapevine, kale or chard leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sarma is part of the broader category of stuffed dishes known as dolma, 
            and has equivalents (such as the Polish Gołąbki) in Eastern European cuisines 
            from the northern Baltic through Ukraine.

            <li>1½ cups hot water, or as needed to cover</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dried currants</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried mint</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried dill weed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) jar grape leaves, drained and rinsed in warm water</li>
            <li>Optional
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until 
                tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in rice, then add enough hot water to cover. 
                Cover and simmer until rice is halfway cooked, about 10 minutes.   
            </li>

            <li>
                Remove from the heat and stir in tomato paste, currants, pine nuts, 
                cinnamon, mint, dill, allspice, and cumin. Let mixture cool, about 15 
                minutes.  
            </li>
            <!-- <img src="../../images/yaprak-sarma-2.webp" alt="Image showing the yaprak sarma after step 2"> -->
            <li>
                Prepare a large pot by placing an inverted plate on the bottom; this will 
                protect the dolmas from direct heat during steaming.
            </li>
            <!-- <img src="../../images/yaprak-sarma-3.webp" alt="Image showing the yaprak sarma after step 3"> -->
            <li>
                Cut off and discard any grape leaf stems. Place about 1 teaspoon cooled 
                rice mixture into the center of a leaf. Fold in the sides, then roll into a 
                cigar shape. Place into the prepared pot. Repeat to make remaining dolmas. 
            </li>
            <!-- <img src="../../images/yaprak-sarma-4.webp" alt="Image showing the yaprak sarma after step 4"> -->
            <li>
                Pour in just enough warm water to reach the bottom of the first layer of 
                dolmas. Cover and simmer over low heat for 30 to 45 minutes, or until rice 
                is totally cooked. Check the water level often and add more as necessary.  
            </li>
